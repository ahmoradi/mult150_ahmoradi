    1. I would say the game is too easy since it lack any fail state.
    2.There needs to be some way to lose. You could possibly make it so the player has lives and needs the keep
    balls from going into a death goal in a addition to trying to get them into the respective goals
    3. Power ups and multiple levels with difference layouts other than just a cube.
    4. It's kinda fun watching the balls bounce around but as a player I feel like I have a lack of control on getting them into the goals.
